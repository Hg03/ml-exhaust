When building a machine learning model, it's very essential to calculate the accuracy of it and for that, we use **evaluation metrics**. There are many types of metrics and we should optimally select the **metric** based on data (mostly we'll focus on target to decide metric)

In this Second Part, we are going to see some of the common evaluation metrics regarding **regression** problem

- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- Root Mean Squared Error
- Mean Percentage Error
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error
- R squared
