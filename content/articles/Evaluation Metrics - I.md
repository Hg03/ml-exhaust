When building a machine learning model, it's very essential to calculate the accuracy of it and for that, we use **evaluation metrics**. There are many types of metrics and we should optimally select the **metric** based on data (mostly we'll focus on target to decide metric)

In this First Part, we are going to see some of the common evaluation metrics regarding **classification** problem

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristtic) or simple AUC
- Log Loss
- Precision at K
- Average Precision at K
- Mean Average Precision at K
